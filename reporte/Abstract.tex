This project consists of the development of an automated irrigation system that, based on an electrical circuit, is capable to make decisions taking into consideration the environmental conditions in real-time. The objective of the project, it is to reduce water consumption at the moment of watering gardens.\\
To design the system, the needs of the local market were investigated. These requirements were obtained on the basis of online surveys, reports and publications, conducted respectively by team members, relevant organizations and specialized universities.\\
Analyzing the information collected, it was determined that the main focus of the system was the irrigation of trees in domestic gardens and that the environmental conditions that most in uence the water consumption by the plants are the water temperature, the quantity supplied with water, soil moisture and the time of day the plant is irrigated.
